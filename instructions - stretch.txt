First things first:

Start Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration 
Enable Serial on Interfaces tap
Setup Pi to your hearts content: Root Password, Overscan, Hostname, Local, Timezone, wifi, teamviewer ...

Setup Wifi I used the GUI because I find it easier.
Setup static IP or set use your router to assign your pi a static IP through DHCP reservations (Advanced and different for each router)

Assemble the Alamode according to the user guide:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HBvd3KNmcs632ZgO6t_u37B-qwV6P9o9FQe62lGkumM/edit

The quick version is this:

on Page 7 follow the instructions to install the headers (requires solidering)

Open LXTerminal (or connect via ssh) and type following commands: 

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo rpi-update
This updates the firmware of your pi.  This will reenable the serial port 

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get update
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get upgrade

Set Your Display Rotation and Resolution

RaspberryPints is built around the notion of a vertical display; that is, a monitor turned to the portrait orientation. While it is not required, many more beers can fit on a display rotated to portrait.

On the desktop, double-click the LX Terminal icon. Depending on your screen size, it may take a few seconds to load.

Type the following, then press enter:

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

If you turned your monitor 90º clockwise, scroll to the bottom and add the following line:

display_rotate=3

If you turned your monitor 90º counter-clockwise, scroll to the bottom and add the following line:

display_rotate=1

Scroll up and down. Look for two lines similar to:

hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=2

These two lines need to be modified to reflect the maximum resolution of your display. Ensure they do not start with a ‘#’, as this symbol tells Raspbian to ignore the line. Some common resolutions are as follows.

For 1920 x 1080 monitor or 1080p TV:
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=16
For 1280 x 720 monitor or 720p TV:
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=4
For 1600 x 1200 monitor:
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=2
For 1680 x 1050 monitor:
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=51
For 1920 x 1200 monitor:
hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=68

To exit, press ‘Ctrl+X’ (Exit).

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo reboot


Install the LAMP Stack
Now we’ll install Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. These four packages are commonly condensed into a stack called “LAMP”.

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get -y install apache2 php7.0 mysql-client mysql-server php7.0-mysql phpmyadmin

mysql-server specifically installs MariaDB, the problem is that the version does not allow a password for the root user, so a new

During the install, ou will be prompted while configuring phpmyadmin, which web serve to reconfigure automatically. The choices are apache2 and lighttpd. Chose apache2 since we were installing it anyway.

Now lets setup an admin user for Raspberry Pints to use to install itself

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo mysql
You will see something like this:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MariaDB connection id is 71
Server version: 10.1.23-MariaDB-9+deb9u1 Raspbian 9.0

Copyright (c) 2000, 2017, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
MariaDB [(none)]>

Enter the following commands not including MariaDB [(none)](Lines that start with MariaDB [(none)]> the other lines are the result)
Feel Free to change the userName(after USER) and password (after IDENTIFIED BY )
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER RaspberryPints@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'RaspberryPints';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> grant all privileges on *.* to RaspberryPints@'%';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MariaDB [(none)]> exit
Bye

If you want to develop Raspberry Pints and dont want to use phpmyadmin you can enable MySql to be accessible remotely by editing
/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
Change bind-address = 127.0.0.1 TO bind-address = 0.0.0.0
Then restart mysql - sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart

The version of stretch I used had chromium preinstall but in case yours didnt
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get -y install chromium-browser

Install Screen Management Packages
In order to display the tap list correctly, we use a couple of different fonts that are not included in the Raspberry Pi operating system. We also need the mouse to hide when not being used, and the screensaver disabled.

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get -y install ttf-mscorefonts-installer x11-xserver-utils unclutter

Disable screen blanking
By default, the screen will blank to a black screen after 15 minutes of inactivity. Clearly, we want to prevent this from happening. With modern displays, image burn-in is rare, and even when it does occur, it’s almost always temporary.

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

Add the following lines at the bottom:
 @xset s off
 @xset -dpms
 @xset s noblank
 @chromium –-kiosk localhost
 
To save, press ‘Ctrl+O’ (WriteOut), then press ‘Enter’ when asked to confirm the filename.
To exit, press ‘Ctrl+X’ (Exit).

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo reboot
 
Now install Flow Meters (SKIP if not installing flow meters...)
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get install arduino python-serial python-mysqldb php5-cli xdotool dos2unix python-mod-pywebsocket

Now lets get the alaMode files needed to connect to it
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ wget https://github.com/wyolum/alamode/raw/master/bundles/alamode-setup.tar.gz

Now from the command line, unpack, 
	get the strech setup (they added it but didnt put it in the bundles at the time of writing),
	convert files to run on linux and install it:

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ tar -xvzf alamode-setup.tar.gz
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cd alamode-setup
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ wget https://github.com/wyolum/alamode/raw/master/alamode-setup/stretch-setup
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo dos2unix ./*
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo ./stretch-setup

Then (install alamode board and meters, if installed skip to "SETUP Raspberry Pints"):
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo shutdown -h now
(this halts the rPi so you can safely remove power)

To Power the Alamode and the rPi, set the 5V_link jumper to on (see page 11). This allows you to connect power to the alamode board 
to power both the alamode and the rPi. This is important as the flow meters will draw more power than the rPi can safely supply via GPIO

To connect the flow meter to the alamode:
Pin1(red) -> Ground
Pin2 (middle)-> Any digital pin 2-13 on the alaMode board. Be sure to set this at the top of the Arduino code
Pin3 -> VIN

Once the alamode has been seated on the rPi (on the gpio pins) and the flow meter has been attached you can power the 
rPi up. Plug the power in to the micro usb on the alamode and not the rPi.

SETUP Raspberry Pints
Goto http://raspberrypints.com/download/ and click Download Now

Open a terminal and change directories to download location)
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo rm /var/www/index.html
If you get an error message stating that the file was not found, you can safely disregard it.
*“x.x.x.x” is the version number you downloaded
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ unzip RaspberryPints-x.x.x.x.zip     
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo mv RaspberryPints-x.x.x.x/* /var/www/ html/    
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html -R 
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ rm -R RaspberryPints-x.x.x.x     

open a web browser and go to localhost it should automatically redirect you to index.php with information to setup raspberry pints. Fill out the form and submit

UPLOAD sketch to Alamode
Log in to the GUI on the rpi and go to the menu -> Programming -> arduino
This opens a program used to edit the ino file for arduino as well as compiler and uploader.
Click on file -> open
Browse to your raspberrypints directory (default /var/www/html/), look for the arduino -> raspberrypints folder and select the raspberrypints.ino file

MAKE A NOTE OF THE PINS AND TAPS you will need this information later.

Go to Tools -> Board and select the Alamode
Go to Tools->Serial and click the box for the serial connection (there should only be one)
In the menu bar there is a button that is a circle with an arrow in it ->
Click that button to compile and upload the ino file to the Alamode board 
**This is important, the alamode needs the code uploaded to it in order to read the flow meters.**

Log in to the admin area of your raspberrypints install.
click on taps
edit the taps and add the pinId.

At this point you should be ready to run the python script.
Copy the flowmon file from the python (/var/www/python) directory to /etc/init.d
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo cp /var/www/html/python/flowmon /etc/init.d
Then give it the proper permissions:
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/flowmon
**IF YOUR INSTALL IS IN /var/www/html you should be good to go forward. if not, you need to edit the 14th line and set the root dir for your install.

You can test the program by running:
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo /etc/init.d/flowmon start 
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ ps aux | grep [f]low_monitor.py
Should return:
 pi 3508 0.0 0.9 8796 4112 ? S 15:35 0:00 /usr/bin/python /home/pi/raspberrypints/python/flow_monitor.py pi 3558 0.0 0.1 3548 808 pts/0 S+ 15:43 0:00 grep --color=auto flow_monitor.py


to ensure it runs at startup Run
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo update-rc.d flowmon defaults

This will start the script. You will not see anything output until you actually pour a pint. When a pint is poured it passes the pin number and the pulse count
to a php script which then updates the pours table in the database and then refreshes the chromium browser on the localhost.
You should also see output on the terminal window where you started the python script.
