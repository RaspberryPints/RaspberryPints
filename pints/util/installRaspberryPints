#
# Simple script to install RaspberryPints
# should work on any Raspbian based system
#
# The script will ask you where you want to install the RaspberryPints application to.
# The default is '/var/www' which is the default location for apache2 websites on Raspbian.
# If you already have a website being served from /var/www, make sure and select a different lcoation.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS
# - Install Raspbian onto your Raspberry Pi and configure the network
# - login as user 'pi' (default password is 'raspberry')
# - Download a raw copy of this script
#     i.e. "wget https://raw.github.com/tssgery/RaspberryPints/master/util/installRaspberryPints"
# - make the script executable
#     i.e. "chmod +x installRaspberryPints"
# - Run the script with root permissions
#     i.e. "sudo ./installRaspberryPints"
# - The script will ask for a default MySQL administrators password. Remember this value as it will be 
#   needed later on in two places (when installing phpMyAdmin and when configuring RaspberryPints)
# - make sure and select that you would like phpmyadmin integrated with apache2
# - You will also be asked for a password for the 'phpmyadmin' user. You should remember this as it
#   is used to log into the phpmyadmin application at http://<ipaddress>/phpmyadmin
# - After the script completes, you should be able to open a web browser pointing to the ip/hostname
#   of the Pi, to configure RaspberryPints
#
# From then on, to update RaspberryPints when changes are committed to the BRANCH used, simply
# - login to the Pi as user 'pi'
# - Change to the directory where you installed RaspberryPints
#     i.e. "cd /var/www"
# - run a git pull as user www-data
#     i.e. "sudo -u www-data git pull"
#

# packages needed to install. This is a default set
